## Background Information
This dataset was curated and annotated by Ishaan Singh, a high school student from India.

The original dataset *(v1)* is composed of 166 images of various cars present in a junkyard. *Training Set: 116 images, Validation Set: 33 images, Testing Set: 17 images*.

The dataset is available under the Public License.

Ishaan ultimately used this dataset to create a "Drone Surveillance" system to count the cars using [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) & [Deep SORT](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort) *(Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric)* for a contest organized by [ComputerVisionZone](https://www.computervision.zone/).

**Here is a video of his final submission for the contest**:
